A simple miniproject i developed while learning the basics of python </br>

<b>About Stone Paper Scissor :</b></br> Stone-Paper-Scissor or Rock-Paper-Scissor is a zero-sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (✊ a simple fist), "paper" (✋ a flat hand), and "scissors" (✌️ a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.</br>
